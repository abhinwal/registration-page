"After your Backend Successfully runs"

### Steps to Set Up and Run the Frontend

1. **Create a Folder:**
   - Name it "angular-17-client" under the same path or folder as the backend (e.g., both frontend and backend on Desktop or Downloads).

2. **Clone the Git Repository:**
   - Navigate to the "angular-17-client" folder.
   - Clone the repository using the following URL: [https://github.com/abhinwal/registration-page](https://github.com/abhinwal/registration-page).

3. **Save All Files:**
   - Navigate to `src -> app -> home` and click "Save" for each file in the home folder.
   - Repeat the same for the `Register` folder.
   - Save all files in the `app` folder, including `app.routing.module.ts`.

4. **Open a New Terminal:**

5. **Set Node Version:**
   - Ensure you are using Node version v18.13.0.
   - Run: `nvm use v18.13.0` (If this version is not available, install it first).

6. **Serve the Angular Application:**
   - In the terminal, navigate to the cloned repository.
   - Execute: `ng serve`.

7. **Check the Webpage:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200/home`.

8. **Troubleshoot Components:**
   - If you face any "component not found" issues, save the corresponding HTML file and then the TypeScript file again. This should resolve the issue.

9. **Fill in the Registration Form:**
   - Fill in all the required information on the webpage and register.

10. **Verify Data in MongoDB:**
    - Reload MongoDB.
    - You should see the data in the `student` collection.
